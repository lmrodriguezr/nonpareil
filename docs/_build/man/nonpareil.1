.sp
Nonpareil uses the redundancy of the reads in metagenomic datasets to estimate the average
coverage and predict the amount of sequences that will be required to achieve "nearly complete
coverage".

.SH INSTALL NONPAREIL
.SS System requirements
.sp
\fBNonpareil binary\fP: Nonpareil requires a C++ compiler. It has been tested on 64\-bit machines with GCC versions ≥4.2.1, running Mac OSX and Red Hat Linux.
.sp
\fBNonpareil utilities\fP: Requires \fI\%R\fP\&. No additional libraries are necessary.

.SH PREPROCESS THE READS
.sp
Nonpareil expects that the sequencing error is always well below 5%, so we suggest using an expected error cutoff of 1%
(i.e., Q>20, or 1 error in 100 nucleotides). We recommend to perform this task using SolexaQA.
.sp
Ideally, the reads should be in FastA format (althought Nonpareil can read FastQ). To transform FastQ into FastA, you
can simply use:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
# Input: reads.fastq
# Output: reads.fasta
cat reads.fastq | paste \- \- \- \- | awk \(aqBEGIN{FS="\et"}{print ">"substr($1,2)"\en"$2}\(aq > reads.fasta
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Also, if you have paired\-end reads, you should use only one sister read per pair in Nonpareil. If you have them interposed
in the same file, you can separate them using \fI\%FastA.split.pl\fP:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
# Input: reads.fasta
# Output: reads.1.fa and reads.2.fa
FastA.split.pl reads.fasta reads 2

.SH REDUNDANCY
.SS For the impatient
.sp
Even if you\(aqre in a hurry, taking a look at \fBpreprocess\fP is very important. If you already did, you can simply run:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
nonpareil \-s reads.fa \-b output
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT

.BI \-o \ <str>
Path to the (output) file where summary is to be saved.   By default the summary is sent to stdout (same
behavior as using a dash \(aq\-\(aq).  If an empty string \(aq\(aq is provided, does not produce the summary. See the
OUTPUT section.

.TP
.B Redundancy summary: \fB\&.npo\fP file
Tab\-delimited file with six columns. The first column indicates the sequencing effort (in number of reads), and the
remaining columns indicate the summary of the distribution of redundancy (from the replicates, 1,024 by default) at
the given sequencing effort. These five columns are: average redundancy, standard deviation, quartile 1, median
(quartile 2), and quartile 3.
.TP
.B Redundancy values: \fB\&.npa\fP file
Tab\-delimited file with three columns. Similar to the .npo files, it contains information about the redundancy at
each sequencing effort, but it provides ALL the results from the replicates, not only the summary at each point. The
first column indicates the sequencing effort (as a fraction of the dataset), the second column indicates the ID of
the replicate (a number used only to introduce some controlled noise in plots), and the third column indicates the
estimated redundancy value.
.TP
.B Mates distribution: \fB\&.npc\fP file
Raw list with the number of reads in the dataset matching a query read. A set of query reads is randomly drawn by
Nonpareil (1,000 by default), and compared against all reads in the dataset. Each line on this file corresponds to a
query read (the order is not important). We have seen certain correspondance between these numbers and the distribution
of abundances in the community (compared, for example, as rank\-abundance plots), but this file is provided only for
quality\-control purposes and comparisons with other tools.
.TP
.B Log: \fB\&.npl\fP file
A verbose log of internal Nonpareil processing. The number to the left (inside squared brackets) indicate the CPU time
(in minutes). This file also provide quality assessment of the Nonpareil run (automated consistency evaluation). Ideally,
the last line should read "Everything seems correct". Otherwise, it suggests alternative parameters that may improve the
estimation.
.UNINDENT
.SH NONPAREIL CURVES
.sp
The estimation of the \fBredundancy\fP is at the core of Nonpareil, but it\(aqs when those values are transformed
into average coverage that they become comporable across samples, and become useful for project design and sample
evaluation.
.sp
To build Nonpareil curves, you need two things. First, the Nonpareil.R file (you can find it in the \fButils\fP folder
of Nonpareil). Second, the \fB\&.npo\fP file (or \fB\-o\fP value, if you used this option) generated in the estimation of
\fBredundancy\fP\&.
.SS For the impatient
.sp
You can simply open \fI\%R\fP and execute:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5

.ft C
source(\(aqutils/Nonpareil.R\(aq);
Nonpareil.curve(\(aqoutput.npo\(aq);
.ft P

.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Changing \fButils/Nonpareil.R\fP and \fBoutput.npo\fP to point to the actual location of the files.
.SS Nonpareil.curve()
.sp
This function can generate a Nonpareil curve from a \fB\&.npo\fP file. The parameters that this function accepts are:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B file
Path to the \fB\&.npo\fP file, containing the read redundancy.
.TP
.B overlap=NULL
Value of the \fB\-L\fP parameter (in Nonpareil, the default is \fB50\fP). If not set, it tries to find the value in the
\fB\&.npo\fP file (supported in Nonpareil ≥2.0), or fails with an error message.
.TP
.B factor=1
Factor by which the number of reads must be multiplied (x\-axis). For example, a factor of 1e\-3 will produce curves
in Kbp (instead of bp). This option should be used when if an "integer overload" is produced, at risk of reducing
the accuracy of the curves.
.TP
.B plotDispersion=NA
Indicates if and how the dispersion of replicates is to be represented. If it\(aqs \fBNA\fP no dispersion is plotted.
Otherwise, it can take the values \fB\(aqsd\(aq\fP: 1 standard deviation around the mean; \fB\(aqci95\(aq\fP: 95% confidence
interval; \fB\(aqci90\(aq\fP: 90% confidence interval; \fB\(aqci50\(aq\fP: 50% confidence interval; \fB\(aqiq\(aq\fP: Inter\-quartile
range.
.TP
.B xmin=1e3, xmax=10e12
Range to plot in the x\-axis (Sequencing effort).
.TP
.B ymax=1, ymin=1e\-6
Range to plot in the y\-axis (Average coverage).
.TP
.B xlab=NULL,ylab=NULL
Labels of the axes. If \fBNULL\fP, the default values are set Sequencing effort (\fIunits\fP) for the x\-axis, and
Estimated average coverage for the y\-axis.
.TP
.B r=NA,g=NA,b=NA,
Values for the red, green, and blue components of the rgb representation of the curve\(aqs color. If \fBNA\fP, random
values are set. If the numbers are in the range [0,1], they are assumed to be fractions of 1 (as interpreted by
rgb). Otherwise, they are assumed to be fractions of 256 (as represented in most color palettes).
.TP
.B new=TRUE
Indicates if a new canvas must be created. If \fBFALSE\fP, it requires that Nonpareil.curve() was previously called
(so a proper canvas exists already). This is useful to create a single plot with several samples (see also
\fI\%Nonpareil.legend()\fP).
.TP
.B plot=TRUE
Indicates if the curve is to be plotted. If \fBFALSE\fP, no plots are generated, but the estimations are.
.TP
.B libname=NA
Name of the library (to be used in later calls of \fI\%Nonpareil.legend()\fP). If \fBNA\fP the base of the filename
(withouth .npo) is used.
.TP
.B modelOnly=FALSE
If \fBTRUE\fP, prints only the fitted model. It also causes variables related to dispersion and curve to be
ignored, and it produces an empty circle denoting the actual size of the dataset and the estimated average
coverage.
.TP
.B plotModel=TRUE
Indicates whether the fitted model is to be included in the plot. If \fBFALSE\fP, it still fits the model to
find the estimate of sequencing effort, but the curve of the model is not included in the plot.
.TP
.B curve.lwd=2
Line width of the curve (the observed curve, not the fitted model).
.TP
.B curve.alpha=0.4
Transparency of the curve.
.TP
.B model.lwd=1
Line width of the fitted model line.
.TP
.B model.alpha=1
Transparency of the fitted model line.
.TP
.B log=\(aqx\(aq
Use logarithmic scale in the X or Y\-axis (or both).
.TP
.B data.consistency=TRUE
Check consistency of the input data before plotting and fitting the model.
.TP
.B useValue=\(aqmean\(aq
Value of the distribution of replicates to be used as the curve. The fitted model and the estimated coverage
is only meaningful when \fBuseValue=\(aqmean\(aq\fP, but all of the following values are supported to allow visual
inspection of the distribution of replicates: The mean (\fB\(aqmean\(aq\fP) or the median (\fB\(aqmedian\(aq\fP) of the
distribution (\fB\(aqmedian\(aq\fP); the upper (\fB\(aqub\(aq\fP) or the lower (\fB\(aqlb\(aq\fP) bound of the 95% confidence interval
(assuming normality); or the first (\fB\(aqq1\(aq\fP) or the third (\fB\(aqq3\(aq\fP) quartile of the ditribution.
.TP
.B star=95
Value of average coverage (in percentage) to be used as \fIalmost complete covereage\fP\&. Usually this value should
be set to 95 or 99, but other estimations can be useful. For example, setting this value to 60 predicts the
minimum sequencing effort at which an assembly with N50 larger than 200bp can be achieved with (100bp\-long)
Illumina reads.
.TP
.B read.length=101
Length of the reads. This value can be found in the \fB\&.npl\fP file, but other estimation (\fIe.g.\fP, the average
length after trimming) can be used.
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBValue\fP: A list with the following keys:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B kappa
Redundancy of the dataset, as calculated by Nonpareil.
.TP
.B C

.TP
.B LRstar
Estimated sequecing effort (in bp) required to reach \fBstar\fP average coverage (95%, by default).
.TP
.B LR
Size of the datasets (in bp).
.TP
.B modelR
Pearson\(aqs correlation coeficient between the calculated values and the fitted model.
.UNINDENT
.SS Nonpareil.legend()
.sp
This function creates a legend for the Nonpareil curve(s) in the (active) plot. It\(aqs compatible with single
or multiple calls of \fI\%Nonpareil.curve()\fP (using \fBnew=F\fP in all but the first call) and with
\fI\%Nonpareil.curve.batch()\fP\&. The parameters that this function accepts are:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP

Vector of characters with the paths to the \fB\&.npo\fP files.
.TP
.B overlap=NULL
Value of the \fB\-L\fP parameter (in Nonpareil, the default is \fB50\fP). It can be a number (if all the curves were
generated with the same value) or a vector (in the same order of \fBfiles\fP). See the \fBoverlap\fP value of
\fI\%Nonpareil.curve()\fP\&.
.TP
.B r=NA,g=NA,b=NA
Values of the corresponding \fBr\fP, \fBg\fP, and \fBb\fP in \fI\%Nonpareil.curve()\fP\&. It can be \fBNA\fP (to set random
colors) or vectors of numbers in the same order of \fBfiles\fP\&.
.TP
.B libnames=NA
Vector of names of the libraries (corresponding to \fBlibname\fP in \fI\%Nonpareil.curve()\fP). It must be characters,
not factors.
.TP
.B read.lengths=NA
A vector of numbers indicating the length of the reads (corresponding to \fBread.length\fP in \fI\%Nonpareil.curve()\fP).
If \fBNA\fP, the default is used.
